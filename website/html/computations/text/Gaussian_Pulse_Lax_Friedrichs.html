Lax-Friedrichs method demonstrates essentially the same behavior as Upwind method. Therefore, all of the considerations regarding Upwind method are applicable to Lax-Friedrichs method.

What can be noted is that the Lax-Friedrichs is slightly more diffusive than Upwind, which results in larger error in norms for Lax-Friedrichs, although the rates of convergence are the same as for Upwind. In fact, the error is approximately twice as large for Lax-Friedrichs, which can be explained, perhaps, by the fact that the Lax-Friedrichs has smaller amplification factors for the low and middle frequencies than Upwind, i.e. those modes are damped faster by Lax-Friedrichs.
