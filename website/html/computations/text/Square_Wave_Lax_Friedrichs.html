Lax-Friedrichs method demonstrates essentially the same behavior as Upwind method. Therefore, all of the considerations regarding Upwind method are applicable to Lax-Friedrichs method.

What can be noted is that the Lax-Friedrichs is slightly more diffusive than Upwind, which results in larger error in norms for Lax-Friedrichs, although the rates of convergence are the same as for Upwind.
