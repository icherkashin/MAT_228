Fromm's method with van Leer slope limiter is able to accurately transport the profile of the shock wave and, in the same time, avoid creation of non-physical extrema.

Although there is no uniform convergence, and convergence rates in other norms are of order less than one, nonlinear correction due to slope limiting is able to meet the physical requirements of the advection problem, which makes this method appropriate for shock wave advection problems.
