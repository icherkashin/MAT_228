Fromm's method for Gaussian Pulse demonstrates all the properties expected from its design: second-order convergence and monotonicity. That is all because all of the assumptions of the truncation error analysis are met in this case: the initial data is infinitely differentiable and gradients are not very steep.

Compared to Lax-Wendroff method, the errors in Fromm's method are practically one-order smaller, which is a consequence of the fact that Fromm's method phase error is nearly 8 times smaller than Lax-Wendroff's phase error.

Thus, Fromm is suitable for sufficiently smooth initial data, although it fails for initial conditions that are not sufficiently smooth, which limits its practical utility, because it is usually necessary to model shock wave propagation accurately, which Fromm cannot do.
