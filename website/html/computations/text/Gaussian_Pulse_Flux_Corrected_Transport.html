Flux-Corrected Transport method for Gaussian Pulse demonstrates first order convergence, although second order is expected. This is because the flux limiter proposed by Boris and Book has an inherent problem know as clipping. The essence of this problem is that the amplitudes of the extrema that already exist in the initial conditions are damped.

Also, one can notice the distortions of the smooth profile of the Gaussian Pulse. This effect is called terracing, and it is an inherent problem with Flux-Corrected Transport, since this method is non-linearity preserving.
