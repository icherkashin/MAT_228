Lax-Wendroff method demonstrates non-physical oscillations near steep gradients, as is predicted by dispersion properties of the method. Also, since Lax-Wendroff is a linear second order method, Godunov's theorem implies that new extrema will be created, which is exactly what is observed.

Naturally, such oscillations, overshoots and undershoots are non-physical and thus Lax-Wendroff method is not appropriate when the initial conditions have steep gradients.
