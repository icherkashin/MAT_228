Lax-Wendroff Fourth Order method for Gaussian Pulse demonstrates all the properties expected from its design: second-order convergence and monotonicity. That is all because all of the assumptions of the truncation error analysis are met in this case: the initial data is infinitely differentiable and gradients are not very steep.

Compared to Lax-Wendroff method, the errors in Lax-Wendroff Fourth Order's method are practically one-order smaller, which is a consequence of the fact that Lax-Wendroff Fourth Order's method phase error is about one order smaller than Lax-Wendroff's phase error.

Thus, Lax-Wendroff Fourth Order is suitable for sufficiently smooth initial data, although it fails for initial conditions that are not sufficiently smooth, which limits its practical utility, because it is usually necessary to model shock wave propagation accurately, which Lax-Wendroff Fourth Order cannot do.
