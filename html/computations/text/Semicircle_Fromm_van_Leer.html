Fromm's method with van Leer slope limiter is able to avoid creation of non-physical extrema in the regions of steep gradients. That is why it is more physically correct than linear Fromm's method, from physical perspective.

Although convergence rates do not exceed one, nonlinear correction due to slope limiting is able to meet the physical requirements of the advection problem, which makes this method appropriate for advection problems with initial data characterized by steep gradients.
