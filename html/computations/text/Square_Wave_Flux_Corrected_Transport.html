Flux-Corrected Transport method is able to avoid creation of non-physical extrema in the regions of discontinuities. That is why it is more physically correct than linear second order methods, from physical perspective.

Although convergence rates do not exceed one, nonlinear flux-correction is able to meet the physical requirements of the advection problem, which makes this method appropriate for advection problems involving shock waves.
