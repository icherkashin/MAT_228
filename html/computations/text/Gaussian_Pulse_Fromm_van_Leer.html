For Gaussian Pulse one would Fromm - van Leer to match Fromm in terms of convergence, but in reality the former has worse convergence results. It is caused by the non-linear slope limiter, which corrects slopes in favor of reducing the order of convergence but preserving monotonicity, which is not necessary for infinitely differentiable initial conditions.
