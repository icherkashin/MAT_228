Flux-Corrected Transport method is able to avoid creation of non-physical extrema in the regions of steep gradients. That is why it is more physically correct than linear second order methods, from physical perspective.

Although convergence rates do not exceed one, nonlinear flux-correction is able to meet the physical requirements of the advection problem, which makes this method appropriate for advection problems when initial conditions are characterized by steep gradients.

Unfortunately, one can notice the distortions of the smooth profile of the wave. This effect is called terracing, and it is an inherent problem with Flux-Corrected Transport, since this method is non-linearity preserving.
