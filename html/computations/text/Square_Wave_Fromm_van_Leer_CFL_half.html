Compared to CFL = 0.9 case, Fromm - van Leer method with CFL = 0.5 demonstrates slightly higher convergence rates. This is because at this CFL number the phase error of Fromm's method becomes one order smaller than its amplitude error, the amplitude error, which is of fourth order, now determines the local truncation error, which becomes one order smaller than the amplitude error, i.e. 3 order.

In other words, reduced phase error of Fromm's method at CFL = 0.5 is responsible for the improvement of convergence rates.
